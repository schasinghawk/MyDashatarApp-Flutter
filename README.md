# MyDashatarApp-Flutter
I created this simple app while learning Flutter. Using Android Studio, I learned how to set up a Flutter project, build a widget tree, and add basic elements like an AppBar, images, and text. From there, I let my imagination take over! There's still so much to learn, but I'm proud of what I've created so far and hope you enjoy it.
